    <p>Apple said to Banana, "Wow, this painting is amazing." Banana asked, "How is it amazing?" Apple replied, "I don’t know, it just feels so cool, like, everything seems so right." Banana said, "Then how do you know what is right and what is wrong?" Apple said, "For example, look at this lizard in front of me. Its purple claws and blue feet feel like the taste is just right, and its perfectly misplaced plastic sheet, and the shiny glossy paint on it—everything feels just right." Banana said, "Okay."</p>

    <h2>Dialogue Between Banana and Orange</h2>
    <p>Banana said to Orange, "Why aren’t you a banana?" Orange replied, "Why are you a banana?" Banana said, "Because I’m a banana, but this statement creates a paradox. I could also be a little bird, and you could be a little bird too, just like how I saw so many little birds on a tree by the lake today. They were all you and me, chirping on that tree." Orange said, "But aren’t you still a banana?" Banana said, "The banana you’re talking about isn’t me." Orange said, "Let’s stop talking about bananas and talk about little birds." Banana said, "Where are the little birds?" Orange said, "The ones you’re hearing chirping outside." Banana said, "I hear bananas, not birds." Orange said, "It’s the birds chirping, not you." Banana said, "Okay, maybe it’s not me chirping."</p>

<div id="Here is heaven and hell" class="poem-container">
    <h2>Here is heaven and hell</h2>
    <p>When faced with the unspeakable, one must remain silent.</p>
    <p>Once one speaks, what is spoken will immediately become a lie.</p>
    <p>A lie is not that the sentence is false, nor is it accusing the speaker of intending to lie. It means that once said, the being will inevitably escape, and the result is a contradiction.</p>
    <p>All sentences are such lies.</p>
    <p>In Chinese, "是" and "在" are two words, but in English, they are one word "be". Sometimes I say "是," sometimes I say "在." They are the same thing.</p>
    <p>"This is this." Therefore, there is no need to say more.</p>
    <p>In this sense, this sentence is one of the closest to being non-lie.</p>
    <p>There are other sentences that have the same proximity to non-lie, such as: I am. </p>
    <p>Here, "same," in mathematics, is abstracted as the equals sign. In language, it is tautology. In this world, it is the identification of "being."</p>
    <p>Truth, goodness, and beauty are a set of tautologies.</p>
    <p>To avoid lying, philosophers use "as if" to speak of "being."</p>
    <p>To avoid contradiction, mystics remain silent.</p>
    <p>Those who claim problems do not exist are lying. At that point, they are called enlightened people.</p>
    <p>Those who claim to solve problems are lying. At that point, they are called moralists.</p>
    <p>Those who act are lying. At that point, they are called artists.</p>
    <p>Those who cancel time due to death are honest.</p>
    <p>Contradiction is the reason things move in time.</p>
    <p>Things that have happened cannot be changed. What has happened is part of the truth, so when time ends, the truth about this world will be fully revealed.</p>
    <p>When a person dies, the truth about them will be fully revealed.</p>
    <p>In time, there is a binary of past and future. When time does not exist, duality disappears.</p>
    <p>At this point, contradiction disappears.</p>
    <p>Time cannot be pointed to. When I say "this moment," that moment has already passed.</p>
    <p>Duality is the misunderstanding of time by space.</p>
    <p>People can only describe time with the language of space. (Compression is inevitable when lower-dimensional existence describes higher-dimensional existence.)</p>
    <p>Good and bad, beauty and ugliness, virtue and vice, are two sides of the same thing.</p>
    <p>Pursuing good will bring bad, pursuing beauty will bring ugliness, and pursuing goodness will bring evil.</p>
    <p>Pursuing sometime will bring nothing, and pursuing nothing will bring something.</p>
    <p>Monastic and secular. The path of being and the path of nothingness lead to the same place.</p>
    <p>I think, therefore I exist. I exist, therefore I think. The causal relationship here is all wrong.</p>
    <p>This is the root of all causal relationships being lies.</p>
    <p>It can be said that when I’m not thinking, or the thinking one is not me, contradiction disappears.</p>
    <p>In this case, the thiking one can not be thought of.</p>
    <p>"Nothing" is a pronoun, and its nature is like that of pronouns such as "God" or "Tao." They cannot point to what they intend to point to.</p>
    <p>Therefore, there is no "nothing," and no "nothing of nothing." And so on.</p>
    <p>At the end of the spiral chain, nothing and being are the same. Atheism and theism are the same.</p>
    <p>All religions tell a great lie, intending to bring people closer to the unspeakable.</p>
    <p>As long as there is intent, there will be lies.</p>
    <p>The religion closest to the core of religion is one that has no words.</p>
    <p>To reach there, the path of language has such a shape: it is spiral, upward (or in some direction), symbolic, arduous, and at some point, it cannot progress or returns to the starting point.</p>
    <p>The endpoint is the starting point.</p>
    <p>There, is here.</p>
    <p>The march of language ends in failure.</p>
    <p>In the failure of language, there is silence. In silence, truth happens.</p>
    <p>Silence has no hierarchy, no high or low. In the indistinguishable silence, I do not exist.</p>
    <p>Death is indifferent to every "I" (everyone dies equally).</p>
    <p>In death, all "I"s do not exist.</p>
    <p>Hence no equals, no non-difference, being non-being, unthinkable.</p>
    <p>Religions that attempt to speak of the afterlife have spoken of the unspeakable.</p>
    <p>Where all "I"s merge into one, entering eternity.</p>
    <p>All ones are the same one.</p>
    <p>All actions done to the "other" return to oneself.</p>
    <p>This is heaven and hell.</p>
    <p>Now, here is heaven and hell.</p>
