    <h2>Dialogue Between Banana and Apple</h2>
    <p>Apple said to Banana, wow this painting is magical. Banana asked, how is it magical? Apple said I don’t know, it's just so sick like my goodness everything seems so right, banana said then how do you know what is right and what is wrong apple said like look at this lizard here, its purple claws and blue feet feel just right, and this perfectly misplaced plastic sheet, and that shiny glossy paint on it everything jus right. Banana said, alright.</p>

<div id="Dialogue Between Banana and Orange" class="poem-container">
    <h2>Dialogue Between Banana and Orange</h2>
    <p>Banana said to Orange, why aren’t you a banana? Orange replied, why are you a banana? Banana said, because I’m a banana, but this sentence creates a contradiction. I could also be a bird, and you could be a bird too, just like how I saw so many birds on a tree by the lake today, they were all you and me, chirping on that tree. Orange said, but aren’t you still a banana? Banana said, the banana you’re talking about isn’t me. Orange said, let’s stop talking about bananas and talk about birds. Banana said, where are the birds? Orange said, the ones you’re hearing chirping outside. Banana said, I hear bananas, not birds. Orange said, it’s the birds chirping, not you. Banana said, alright, maybe it’s not me chirping.</p>

<div id="Here is Heaven and Hell" class="poem-container">
    <h2>Here is Heaven and Hell</h2>
    <p>When faced with the unspeakable, one must remain silent.</p>
    <p>Once one speaks, what is spoken will immediately become a lie.</p>
    <p>A lie is not that the sentence is false, nor is it accusing the speaker of intending to lie. It means that once said, the being will inevitably escape, and the result is a contradiction.</p>
    <p>All sentences are such lies.</p>
    <p>In Chinese, "是" and "在" are two words, but in English, they are one word "be". Sometimes I say "是," sometimes I say "在." They are the same thing.</p>
    <p>"This is this." Therefore, there is no need to say more.</p>
    <p>In this sense, this sentence is one of the closest to being non-lie.</p>
    <p>There are other sentences that have the same proximity to non-lie, such as: I am. </p>
    <p>Here, "same," in mathematics, is abstracted as the equals sign. In language, it is tautology. In this world, it is the identification of "being."</p>
    <p>Truth, goodness, and beauty are a set of tautologies.</p>
    <p>To avoid lying, philosophers use "as if" to speak of "being."</p>
    <p>To avoid contradiction, mystics remain silent.</p>
    <p>Those who claim the questions do not exist are lying. They are called enlightened people.</p>
    <p>Those who claim to solve the questions are lying. They are called ethicists.</p>
    <p>Those who act are lying. They are called artists.</p>
    <p>Those who cancel time due to death are honest.</p>
    <p>Contradiction is the reason things move in time.</p>
    <p>Things that have happened cannot be changed. What has happened is part of the truth, so when time ends, the truth about this world will be fully revealed.</p>
    <p>When a person dies, the truth about them will be fully revealed.</p>
    <p>In time, there is a binary of past and future. When time does not exist, duality disappears.</p>
    <p>At this point, contradiction disappears.</p>
    <p>Time cannot be pointed to. When I say "this moment," that moment has already passed.</p>
    <p>Duality is the misunderstanding of time by space.</p>
    <p>People can only describe time with the language of space. (Compression is inevitable when lower-dimensional beings describe higher-dimensional beings.)</p>
    <p>Good and bad, beauty and ugliness, virtue and vice, are two sides of the same thing.</p>
    <p>Pursuing good will bring bad, pursuing beauty will bring ugliness, and pursuing virtue will bring vice.</p>
    <p>Pursuing something will bring nothing, and pursuing nothing will bring something.</p>
    <p>Secular or monastic, the way of being and the way of nothingness lead to the same place.</p>
    <p>I think, therefore I am. I am, therefore I think. The causal relationships here are all wrong.</p>
    <p>This is the root of all causal relationships being lies.</p>
    <p>It can be said that when I am not thinking, or the thinking being is not "I", contradiction disappears.</p>
    <p>In this case, the thiking being can not be thought of.</p>
    <p>"Nothing" is a pronoun, and its nature is like that of pronouns such as "God" or "Tao." They cannot point to what they intend to point to.</p>
    <p>Therefore, there is no "nothing," and no "no nothing." And so on.</p>
    <p>At the end of the spiral chain, nothingness and existence are one. Atheism and theism are the same.</p>
    <p>All religions tell a great lie, intending to bring people closer to the unspeakable.</p>
    <p>As long as there is intent, there will be lies.</p>
    <p>The religion closest to the core of religion is one that has no words.</p>
    <p>To reach there, the path of language has such a shape: it is spiral, upward (or in some direction), symbolic, arduous, and at some point, it cannot progress or returns to the starting point.</p>
    <p>The beginning is the end.</p>
    <p>There is here.</p>
    <p>The march of language ends in failure.</p>
    <p>In the failure of language, silence begins. In silence, truth happens.</p>
    <p>Silence has no hierarchy, no high or low. In the indistinguishable silence, I do not exist.</p>
    <p>Death is indifferent to every "I" (everyone dies equally).</p>
    <p>In death, all "I"s do not exist.</p>
    <p>Hence no equal, no non-difference, being non-being.</p>
    <p>Religions that attempt to speak of the afterlife have spoken of the unspeakable.</p>
    <p>There, all "I"s merge into one, entering eternity.</p>
    <p>All are the same one.</p>
    <p>All actions done to the "other" return to oneself.</p>
    <p>This is heaven and hell.</p>
    <p>Now, here is heaven and hell.</p>
